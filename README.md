# Detecting-Fake-News-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
The spread of misinformation, or "fake news," is a significant issue in today's digital society. This project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a machine-learning model capable of analyzing news articles and classifying them as "real" or "fake."

## Following Steps & To-do's:

- [ ] Search for Datasets and record source/ideas on [Datasets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZAJRoiReq_z9ilW6BCkTsyaTOXu-gpDJs10uEqnFxuU/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Choose one of this datasets
- [ ] Write [Stakeholders, Deliverables, and Dataset document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QYoArg_Tspz9DMUaUZW-JQ5L7bWfVSuiV1cnxe9IOw/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] Dump everything we think of and vote on Sunday (Soft Deadline: Sunday 21st)
- [ ] Plan for end of project
- [ ] Start with data pre-processing (choose methods, etc.)
- [ ] Set internal deadlines

### Erdos soft deadlines:

#### Data gathering and defining stakeholders + KPIs - May 19, 2023
Find the dataset you will be working with. Describe the dataset and the problem you are looking to solve (1 page max). List the stakeholders of the project and company key performance indicators (KPIs) (bullet points).

#### Data cleaning + preprocessing - May 19, 2023

Look for missing values and duplicates. Basic data manipulation & preliminary feature engineering.

#### Exploratory data analysis + visualizations [Checkpoint] - May 26, 2023

Distributions of variables, looking for outliers, etc. Descriptive statistics.

#### Written proposal of modeling approach [Checkpoint] - May 26, 2023

Test linearity assumptions. Dimensionality reductions (if necessary). Describe your planned modeling approach, based on the exploratory data analysis from the last two weeks (< 1 page, bullet points).

#### Machine learning models or equivalent [Checkpoint] - Jun 1, 2023

Results with visualizations and/or metrics. List of successes and pitfalls.

#### Final project due - Jun 3, 2023
