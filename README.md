## Project Description
The spread of misinformation, or "fake news," is a significant issue in today's digital society. This project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a machine-learning model capable of analyzing news articles and classifying them as "real" or "fake."

In this project, we are using known classifier models to predict if news articles are FAKE or REAL. However, this has been done before. Therefore, to see if we can increase the accuracy of these models, we are going to create synthetic features for the characteristics of these news that we think are important. We will then use these features to train our models and see if we can increase the accuracy of our predictions.

Some of the synthetic features we are going to create are:
- The number of grammatical and spelling errors in the article
- The number of times the article uses the word "I" or "me"
- The use of emotional words in the article
- The number of words used with capital letters
- The use of numbers in the article
- The use of long words (more than 10, 15 characters) in the article
- Topic modeling of the article using BERT
