# Deadlines / TODOs
	- Friday. Finish (1) exploratory data analysis (EDA) on your training set and add this into Shayne's presentation slides. We will edit the slides later.
	- Friday. Add the EDA you did to your base model and see how much it improves the model
	- Friday morning. Optional meeting to discuss and finish presentation slides.
	- Friday some time after 3:30 PM. Meet with Thomas one last time to show him our slides for feedback.
	- On Saturday. Make video based on powerpoint and submit final project.

# How the presentation could look like

Two stories we could tell; we'll decide on the story we use after 
	- Create a classifier for people to use, or
	- Turns out, if we add features to our base model, we can get better accuracy.

How the presentation can be formatted as:
	- See Shayne's slides
	- First set up the problem, motivating why a model is needed [Done by Shayne?]
	- EDA to show the quality of our data. For instance, if we see that our data consists mostly of political news, then we know it is useful for predicting political news, but not for sports or technology news. Or, the fake news dataset has more racism-related content, then this biases how our model will predict fake / real news.
	- Present how our model works and its performance
Here are the uses of our model
